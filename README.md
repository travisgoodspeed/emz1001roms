Howdy y'all,

This repo contains my collection of ROM photographs for the ISKRA
EMZ1001 and AMI S2000 chips.  These were 4-bit microcontrollers make
in Yugoslavia under license, and it would be nice to reverse engineer
them.

To decode bits to bytes, we will use
[MaskRomTool](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/maskromtool/).  To
disassemble the ROM, we will use
[GoodASM](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/goodasm/).

Greetings to the Computer History Museum in Ljubljana./x

Cheers from Novi Sad,
