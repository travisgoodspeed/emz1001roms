Howdy y'all,

This repo contains my collection of ROM photographs for the ISKRA
EMZ1001 and AMI S2000 chips.  These were 4-bit microcontrollers make
in Yugoslavia under license, and it would be nice to reverse engineer
them.

To decode bits to bytes, we will use
[MaskRomTool](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/maskromtool/).  To
disassemble the ROM, we will use
[GoodASM](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/goodasm/).  A Verilog recreation
of the chip is available as [sys_emz1001](https://github.com/zpekic/sys_emz1001).

Greetings to the [Computer History
Museum](https://www.racunalniski-muzej.si/en/the-latest-findings-about-the-4-bit-iskra-emz-1001-part-2/)
in Ljubljana.

Cheers from Novi Sad,

--Travis
